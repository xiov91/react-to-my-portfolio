                I'm Xiomara--that's Zee for those who don't like a mouthful. I'm nearly at the end of my Full Stack Coding Bootcamp,
                and I'm loving all the different things I've been able to learn. I'm excited to continue the trend and branch out into Python
                and C# to expand my skills and continue down my path of both web development and game development.
